# Project Summary

MY IDEA for this coffee making game is that the program allows to make a chosen coffee by choosing the rigt answers. It gives an output if coffee is too strong, too hot, too week or it is perfect. This program could be used:

1. For guests in coffee shop while waiting their coffee (a guest can compare if he manages to do the perfect virtual coffee while barista is doing the real one.
2. For new baristas to learn how to make coffee.
3. For searching of new talents in coffee shop - for example to have this game on a coffee shop page "Career" section.

EXPERIENCE while making the program:
* It was quite hard to combine separate functions and methods in one program;
* It felt very good finally fix bugs and get the expected result;
* It took more time to think about the logic while creating the program than actually writing the code and seeing result.

What could be improved:
1. A Timer - could be shown on the screen while playing, stop the game if provided time is over, add time penalty for wrong answers.
2. More choices with different questions.
3. Restart the game if coffee making choices makes no sence (user chooses small cup and adds too much milk).

TIME BUDGET: I already used 27 hours to create this project. I will use last 3 hours to improve with the timer. 

# User Guide

1. Open the program.
2. There are 3 coffee choices. Choose one and press the button.
3. First question which pops up on the screen has 2 choices. Select one by pressing the button. 
4. Next 4 questions have 3 choices each. Choose one by pressing the button.
5. Press BACK button if you want to go back to the previous question.
6. Press RETURN button if you want the game to start over.
7. After 5th question you will get the output on the screen either you did everything right and you are a Master Barista either you will get the output what is wrong with your coffee.
